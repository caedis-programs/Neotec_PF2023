## How will the PF look?

After someone opens the link they'll see a 4x3 pexeso board of backs of the pexeso cards.

Back of the cards is dark blue (#002a7d) with NeoTec logo on top.

After user clicks on a card, it'll reveal the front, which will be slightly lighter blue and one of the following characters P; F; 2; 0; 2; 2 (there are 3 types of 2s depending on the font).
Characters P; F; 2 and 0 are in font Rubik Distressed, second 2 is in font Rubik Microbe and third is in font Rubik Burned.
User must find the right matches just like in normal game of pexeso.

When a match is found the character is placed in its place in a text bellow the board.

When all letters are collected small text below the board move bit above the center of the screen and get bigger,
the last 2 will change to 3 and a "Merry Xmas" text appears with signatures of all the employees of the company.
